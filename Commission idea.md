## General information
I expect commission to be semi-simple and shaded. There should be 2 posed characters, in a different poses. Aspect ratio, should be 1:1 or close to it, since there wouldn't be really much action, for having a different ratio. Image resolution is up to you, but I'd be genuinely like if it would be higher than 2048x2048, thank you.
## Background
I expect background being very simple. It should be white and similar to first Zootopia trailer (or The Stanley Parable). Just a plain white, with some slight shadows, just to show that the characters aren't floating, but standing on the ground. It shouldn't need to be exactly `#ffffff`, if you have different light color, you can use it here. Yet so, I'd prefer it to be in colder tones, rather than warm ones.
## Characters
### 1. Wilford Bronson

*These 3 images are already good at presenting him, as a character, but let me give a little bit more details.*

As you see by the full name, Wilford is a character, based on the Echoverse. In this case, he is a Sydney Bronson. To not go with unnecessary lore description why he has a different name, I'll better explain the other things. 
##### General
Wilford has a dark red fur, rather than brown. Unlike the *semi*-canon Sydney, he isn't a muscular at all. This was the reason why have I asked about the ability to draw non-muscular characters. He is a 175cm (5'8") river otter, with a ~63kg (~139lbs) body weight. He doesn't have a visible abs, but some abdomen muscles are still quite visible. This makes him being thin and, if you want it to call that way, look like a twink. 
##### Head
Wilford wears rectangle-ish fisherman cap. Except it's blinder is long enough to cover up his eyes. His cap is made of some semi-reflective material (not full glossiness, I think roughness ~0.33[^1] in blender is quite feels similar), which gives nice patterns and colors on sun glare. His cap looks quite used enough, since he got it almost 10 years ago, but he doesn't get rid of it, because he was one of the 1000 persons, who won it on some wrestling-related contest. That's why it has some sewed patch to it's side, which says says the serial number and the name of the wrestling event.

*This man, wears the exact same cap, I want to see on Wilford.*

 Wilford also wears an industrial piercing on his left ear. It's placed closer to the top of his ear and. It's a silver barbell, with 2 bulbs on start and the end, horizontally going throughout his ear.

*This piercing looks almost exactly like his, except that gem in the middle. Wilford's piercing should be a straight bar.*

He also has red (somewhere around `#b43c26`) iris and white sclera.
##### Body
As mentioned in [[Commission idea#General|General]], Wilford has a thin body, which is having some piercings as well. 
Wilford has a 2 titanium rectangular nipple ring piercings, each ~6.7mm (~0.26 in) thick.
##### Lower Body
Wilford legs are the only part, which can be considered muscular, for a bit. He is a good runner, and can do 23 squats. Due to that, his butt isn't flat.
He doesn't like wear any clothes at home, besides some meshed jockstrap. His jocks are gold yellow with a semi-thick (~3cm (~1.18 in)) white waistband. 

He doesn't wear any footwear. No boots and no socks.
### 2. Jacob Turner
Jacob is an OC made by me. He is Wilford's buddy and another part of this artwork.
##### General
Jacob shares the height with Wilford, but not the weight. He is 80kg river otter. He has a sleeper build, and quite a rounded belly, since he doesn't sit on a diet. To addition, he prefers to hide his muscles under baggy clothes. This makes him look a bit more overweight rather than muscular.
##### Head
Jake doesn't wear any headgear, nor having any piercings, but he has dyed hair ends on his fringe, in a brick red color (`#e63917`). Besides that he has a teal (`#1fde98`) iris and white sclera
##### Body
Jacob wears a purple oversized cotton hoodie, with a certain print. This print contains an eyeless wolf, which has billiard 8 ball in eye sockets. Eye sockets are bleeding. This print is all over this hoodie and looks like a vector painting, rather than a detailed art. 
He doesn't wear it's hood, leaving it on the back, but it's aglets are 
##### Lower Body
He doesn't wear anything special, just a light-colored baggy jeans, with no print or any rip. They are being held by a white leather belt.

## Composition
Both characters should be placed next to each other, on the center of a canvas. 
Wilford is sideways standing on a single leg, smoking a cigarette. Cap is halfway covering his eyes. As mentioned in his description, he shouldn't wear any clothes, but a cap and jocks. He also puts his elbow on Jacob's shoulder, leaning all of his weight on it. Wil's pose is open, he looks nonchalantly. 
Jacob standing towards the viewer, slightly sweating and stretching a smile, looking like everything is fine. His pose is close, one arm is in the pocket (up to you, should it be hoodie pocket or jeans pocket) and the other one is waving. Jake is wearing the mentioned clothes.
