## General information
I expect commission to be semi-simple and shaded. There should be 2 posed characters, in a different poses. Aspect ratio, should be 1:1 or close to it, since there wouldn't be really much action, for having a different ratio. Image resolution is up to you, but I'd be genuinely like if it would be higher than 2048x2048, thank you.
## Background
I expect background being very simple. It should be white and similar to first Zootopia trailer (or The Stanley Parable). Just a plain white, with some slight shadows, just to show that the characters aren't floating, but standing on the ground. It shouldn't need to be `#ffffff`, if you have different light color, you can use it here. Yet so, I'd prefer it to be in colder tones, rather than warm ones.
## Characters

*These 3 images are already good at presenting him, as a character, but let me give a little bit more details.*

As you see by the full name, Wilford is a character, based on the Echoverse. In this case, he is a Sydney Bronson. To not go with unnecessary lore description why he has a different name, I'll better explain the other things. 
##### General
Wilford has a dark red fur, rather than brown. Unlike the *semi*-canon Sydney, he isn't a muscular at all. This was the reason why have I asked about the ability to draw non-muscular characters. He is a 175cm (5'8") river otter, with a ~63kg (~139lbs) body weight. He doesn't have a visible abs, but some abdomen muscles are quite visible. This makes him being thin and, if you want it to call that way, look like a twink. 
##### Head
Wilford wears rectangle-ish fisherman cap. Except it's blinder is long enough to cover up his eyes. His cap is made of some semi-reflective material (not full glossiness, I think roughness ~0.33[^1] in blender is quite feels similar), which gives nice patterns on sun glare. His cap looks quite used enough, since he got it almost 10 years ago.

*This man, wears the exact same cap, I want to see on Wilford.*

 Wilford also wears an industrial piercing on his left ear. It's placed closer to the top of his ear and. It's a silver barbell, with 2 bulbs on start and the end, horizontally going throughout his ear.

*This piercing looks almost exactly like his, except that gem in the middle. Wilford's piercing should be a straight bar.*

He also has red (somewhere around `#b43c26`) iris and white sclera.
##### Body
As mentioned in [[Commission idea#General|General]], Wilford has a thin body. His body is pierced as well. 
Wilford has a 2 titanium nipple ring piercings. They aren't circular, but rectangular, each ~6.7mm (~0.26 in) thick.
He doesn't like wear any clothes at home, besides jockstrap. His jocks are gold yellow with a semi-thick (~3cm (~1.18 in)) white waistband. 
##### Lower Body
Wilford legs are the only part, which can be considered muscular, for a bit. He is a good runner, and can do 23 squats. He doesn't have a really developed "bubble butt", yet so, this part, isn't flat at all.
He doesn't have any footwear. No boots and no socks.

### Jacob Turner
Jacob is an OC made by me. He is Wilford's buddy and another part of this artwork.
##### General
Jacob shares the height with Wilford, but not the weight. He is 80kg river otter. He has a sleeper build, and quite a rounded belly, since he doesn't sit on a diet. To addition, he prefers to hide his muscles under baggy clothes. This makes him look a bit more overweight rather than muscular.
##### Head
Jake doesn't wear any headgear, nor having any piercings, but he has dyed hair ends.
