## General information
I expect commission to be semi-simple and shaded. There should be 2 posed characters, in a different poses. Aspect ratio, should be 1:1 or close to it, since there wouldn't be really much action, for having a different ratio. Image resolution is up to you, but I'd be genuinely like if it would be higher than 2048x2048, thank you.
## Background
I expect background being very simple. It should be white and similar to first Zootopia trailer (or The Stanley Parable). Just a plain white, with some slight shadows, just to show that the characters aren't floating, but standing on the ground. It shouldn't need to be `#ffffff`, if you have different light color, you can use it here. Yet so, I'd prefer it to be in colder tones, rather than warm ones.

*These 3 images are already good at presenting him, as a character, but let me give a little bit more details.*

As you see by the full name, Wilford is a character, based on the Echoverse. In this case, he is a Sydney Bronson. To not go with unnecessary lore description why he has a different name, I'll better explain the other things. 
##### General
Unlike the *semi*-canon Sydney, Wilford isn't a muscular at all. This was the reason why have I asked about the ability to draw non-muscular characters. He is a 175cm (5'8") river otter, with a ~63kg (~139lbs) body weight. This makes him being thin and, if you want it to call that way, look like a twink. Besides that, his fur is more red, rather than brown.
##### Head
Wilford wears rectangle-ish fisherman cap. Except it's blinder is long enough to cover up his eyes. His cap is made of some semi-reflective material (not full glossiness, I think roughness ~0.33[^1] in blender is quite feels similar), which gives nice patterns on sun glare. His cap looks quite used enough, since he got it almost 10 years ago.

He also wears an industrial piercing on his left ear. It's placed closer to the top of his ear and almost tilted at 90°. It's a silver barbell, with 2 bulbs on start and the end, going through his entire ear, by horizontal.

*This piercing looks almost exactly like his, except that gem in the middle. Wilford's piercing should be a straight bar*
