## General information
I expect commission to be semi-simple and shaded. There should be 2 posed characters, in a different poses. Aspect ratio, should be 1:1 or close to it, since there wouldn't be really much action, for having a different ratio. Image resolution is up to you, but I'd be genuinely like if it would be higher than 2048x2048, thank you.
## Background
I expect background being very simple. It should be white and similar to first Zootopia trailer (or The Stanley Parable). Just a plain white, with some slight shadows, just to show that the characters aren't floating, but standing on the ground. It shouldn't need to be `#ffffff`, if you have different light color, you can use it here. Yet so, I'd prefer it to be in colder tones, rather than warm ones.
