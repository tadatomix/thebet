## General information
I expect commission to be semi-simple and shaded. There should be 2 posed characters, in a different poses. Aspect ratio, should be 1:1 or close to it, since there wouldn't be really much action, for having a different ratio. Image resolution is up to you, but I'd be genuinely like if it would be higher than 2048x2048, thank you.
## Background
I expect background being very simple. It should be white and similar to first Zootopia trailer (or The Stanley Parable). Just a plain white, with some slight shadows, just to show that the characters aren't floating, but standing on the ground. It shouldn't need to be `#ffffff`, if you have different light color, you can use it here. Yet so, I'd prefer it to be in colder tones, rather than warm ones.
## Characters
### Wilford Bronson
As you see by the name, Wilford is a character, based on the one from Echoverse. In this case, this is a Sydney Bronson. To not go with unnecessary lore description why he has a different name, I'll better explain other things. 
##### General
Unlike the *semi*-canon Sydney, Wilford isn't a muscular man at all. This was the reason why have I asked about the ability to draw non-muscular characters. He is a 175cm (5'8") river otter, with a ~63kg (~139lbs) body weight. This makes him being thin and, if you want it to call that way, look like a twink. Besides that, his fur is more red, rather than brown.
##### Head
Wilford wears an industrial piercing on his left ear. It's placed closer to the  top of his ear and tilted almost at 80°.
![[industrial-piercing_1200x630.webp|Lol]]This piercing looks almost like his, except that gem in the middle. Wilford's piercing should be a straight bar
