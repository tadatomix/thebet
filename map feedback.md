1. apple
	1. grid snap is restrictive which is not good
	2. try to pay more attention to axises
2. into the night
	1. it's a funky freeform. that's good, but needs better implementation
	2. object relations aren't made well
3. piece of me
	1. change the spacing for better following the piano
	2. 00:10:617 (2) - not a good simplification, since it's better to follow syllables, instead of a full word
	3. 00:12:093 (2) - should have a better rotation for connection with straight slider
	4. patterning for specific instrument is more than welcome
	5. 00:18:240 (1,2) -  - should be more consistent
	6. less stacking, since it's not a slowpart (*in case with such a song*)
	7. 00:23:650 (1);00:27:584 (1) - is quite boring, might need a different rhythm
	8. have wrong follow of a pitch. higher one better should be followed with notes, lower with sliders
	9. 00:30:044 (1,2,3,4) - SV and spacing here should have a better vocal following 
	10. 00:31:519 (1,2,1,2) - good symetry pattern
	11. Overall chorus might need more intensity
	12. Make more equilateral triangles in patterns
	13. 00:39:388 (1) - not the best overlap
