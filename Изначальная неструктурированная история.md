So, how's that happened, heh? Well, when I woke up and met with mah roommate Jake, I went to office. I was completely tired and then someone slammed into my cabinet. Since I still was waking up, I thought it's our city crazy Markus, since he always was coming up at that time to say again that someone stole his precious thing, in fact, his sock, which was in his washing machine, so I said bluntly "What now, Markus? Miss Fletcher grabbed your bottle of Lager and now ya need mah help to find it?". He actually joked back, when I was saying something like this, but after I heard a growl, I stated to realize that it wasn't him. After I rubbed eyes, in front of me was staying completely mad otter with red eyes, which was ready to punch me. Also he was heavy panting. After some time, I finally started to fill the blank of work with his case. Our PCs by IBM were completely slow, so I always did all of the work on a typewriter and then OCRd it with my PC at home, but after first ring of bell, he was really mad and yelled at me, asking, why couldn't I use a PC next to me. Being tired of that attitude, I, especially for him, opened Word on this machine, pressed "H" button, after what PC completely froze. Without telling anything, I continued filling the case with his blathers. Life as a kid, teenager life, recent life in 2015, when it's 2017... What do this otter need from me? After last ring of bell, I sighed. Still being annoyed, he decided to ask me again why couldn't I just use "this fucking PC" next to me, so I pressed "H" button again. Among with 2 existing "H", PC froze again to think how to show another "H" in 14pt Times New Roman. I sighed.
I looked at this otter and decided to ask him, what do he need from me and what is this attitude of his. He was again mad, but now, because, he could book a time, like a normal person, but happened that "no one was on the line" (actually, they might haven't come yet and it was written in our website, but since no one was updating it since 1996 (it was clearly obvious by our PCs) it was really hard to find that information, but since we had it still, we, technically haven't broke the law, so whatever) also he was completely annoyed by hold tune. Since, I wasn't the one, who really used this line and usually our guys answering to calls really fast, I forgot that one genius decided to put, as a April Fools joke, flute cover of Toxic by Britney Spears. Before knowing this, I wanted to say, that he's just a mad bitch, but after that, I stopped. He still was mad, so being tired of this, I decided just to stand up to ask him again this question. At this moment, I found out that he was really short for his 24 years, I really needed to lower my head to see this otter. After small confusion, I continued: –"So why did you came up here, first?" –"Whyddya came up, man?! Whyddya came up?! I need answers! Since 9 years old, I can't understand what's happened with my dad and my home city! And those people recommended ya as a "Top Tier Detective", 'round there. S'will ya help me or not?" I really spent a time to understand his accent. It was really wild, like he's lacking of some consonants, saying some words differently and also his voice wasn't the one, I've expected from someone like he. I thought for a while, it felt like way more interesting case with some possible culprits and victims, rather than another work with Markus. After a groan, I've agreed. –"Fine... I'm ready to help you." When he opened his mouth, I've added –"But, we're working by my rules. I'll listen to your opinion, but not to your attitude, understandable?" He rolled his eyes –"Yeah, yeah, whatever"
Last what Dean said was –"Then, if you're ready, at the reception, fill and sign couple of agreements and pay down payment." At this moment started their saga with finding mysteries of someone called Mr. Bronson and city called Echo
End of [[Глава 1. Знакомство]]
Also, for now, I don't ask much questions about his current life, since I know it might lead me to deal with his aggressive attitude
It's quite confusing seeing using those old things at 2017. My roommate Jake, of course, have this hobby, but that's the point. Don't think that this person will just start buying random Betamax recorders from thrift shops, just to try to fix them...
Meanwhile, I think, Jake's room is just filled with burned rosin smell already, due to how often do he fix this stuff
Well, atleast Jake resells em to interested in this people... Anyways, guess time to start gathering clues. It's all so fucked, god... Too little input info... –"So... You say that your father had died somewhere in this city, leading to anomalies... Right...?" I still was unsure about all of this, since he wasn't the one who gave much details. He answered. –"Yeah, lemme navigate cha to the place where he had died." He started waving at some place, which was hard to see, but I've nodded. So we started heading to that place.
While we were heading I had many questions, to ask him. They fastly flew off, when I heard quiet humming sound – "Huh? I thought all people were evacuated from this place at... 2015, where's that sound coming from?" He just laughed – "Oh, ya dunno? We're in haunted city now. It's full of anomalies and ghosts, but I feel like no one actually believed me till that night at 2015." I just blinked. I heard that Echo had some paranormal activity in 1915 which was tied to death of some miner, but I thought that's it's just a tale to scare kids or something. We silently continued heading to that place. Starry sky, same paths and trees, felt like he had tried to confuse me. But at one moment, hum became really loud that I needed to cover my ears. He noticed it. – "Forgot that coyotes can hear more than we, heh." I decided to calm myself up and caught a breath. Had worse cases, some small hum from this old engine will not scare me. – "Fine, I need to take some investigation first. Like check inside outside the van, maybe we find something here." I grabbed out of my pocket flashlight and turned it on. While humming some song in my head to distract myself of how weird that entire situation looked like, I started noticing some strange things. Some blood stains, some average scratches, some intentional scratches like "x is a whore" - someone decided to cover the name with marker and added "dat willn't go unpunished" whatever that meant. At the windshield there were left couple pieces of paper, which felt like an ad, I'm usually getting rid of in Allen. When I grabbed one of them it had some phone number. – "+1 (385) 329-2919..." I mumbled reading it. – "Do you remember this phone number somewhere?" I decided to ask, still staring at it. – "Man, I don't think that some random number will help us in finding cause of my father's de–" Then he heard tone dial sound on my phone. I started calling that number from a paper
After some continuous tone sounds, someone picked up the phone. After I heard monotone robotic voice. All came together. – "**Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. 1 3 8 5 3 2 9 2 9 1 9 is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options.** _**BEEP**_" _I rolled my eyes, but decided to give it a try._ – "Detective Hùndùn on the line. I need some help of yours in investigating a case of Echo's Hysteria. Thank you, in advance." Then I hung up and shrugged. – "Hope dies last. Maybe they will call me back." – "They better will." Sydney felt like it was waste of the time, but maybe it really was left by some resident of Echo he didn't know about. I decided to read another paper. It was some car repair advertisement. Nothing really important, but I decided to put them back first and take a picture. There's never enough clues. After that, I grabbed those papers and took separate pictures of them too. Otter noticed the text on one of them. – "Wait? Alvarez Auto up? Mah fella **Leonardo** works there." I silently nodded and put those papers in my pocket. Then continued looking outside of this van. Then I spotted one key clue. – "Two pistols for a hunting shotgun..." I grabbed one of them and started rotating it in my paw. – "Was a shotgun cause of his death?" He felt quite unamused by that question. – "Yes, smartass. I told ya that he killed himself there, using his shotgun." I covered my face with a paw, sighing. – "Oh, so for what we are here then?" – "Because, I thought you'll explain me motive of doing this?" Suddenly I went back to reality and calmed myself up. – "Fine, those pistols still will be really helpful." After that I put then in some small zip package and decided to check insides of this car. It was locked from any side. I slightly groaned. – "Have a keys?"
He looked at me with "are you fucking kidding me?" expression" – "Keys? I'm not even sure is it his van or not." Groaning, I rolled my eyes and decided to go other way. – "Fine..." Anyone who sees me for the first time, usually ask me why do I carry harpin, if they notice it. Then I open their Honda Civic or Buick with it and they start to think about changing their locks. Classique. After some manipulations, one of the doors of this van was opened. Inside, van felt even more abandoned. Web, dust all around, also it was really dark. I went inside. Everything felt completely silent and empty, but then I heard this. Felt like someone turned on the radio and started adjusting it. – "Sydney? What t–" He wasn't even near that radio. Then I saw it. Something that looked like a thin short otter, even thinner and shorter than Sydney, without eyes. Seeing it for the first time made me shocked, so I fell on the back. – "地㞗獄?!" Sydney heard that I fell down and decided to ask. – "Evrything's aight, detective?" When I decided to highlight that place where I saw that creature, it's just disappeared. – "Just a hallucination, I think. Anyways, there's no potential clues inside. Just an abandoned van." I still looked around to see anything else, but all I've found here was seat covers. I grabbed those too. Then, I went back, holding two piece of fabric and locked van again. Shaking off the dust from my coat, I said. – "Well, think that only these things could tell us something about the owner. We also need to gather some evidence from residents of this city, since for now, 2 ads, seat covers and pistols aren't quite help us... Would actually be nice if we had access to some city's documents, but..." He interrupted me. – "Think I can try to manage it, if we're gonna take evidence from fellas soon..." I nodded. – "Would be great, since we could faster manage what's going on here." Before we went back, to be sure, I also wrote license plate from a van in my notes. **N29 U47**
Heading back to my car, my had was filled with questions about this strange creature. Who is it? Why it was in van? Why among this van I heard continuous hum? Those questions were interrupted by quiet mumbling from otter. He looked at me, like waiting for the answer, so I asked. – "What?" – "Yer car have an AUX?" I blinked, being confused, but nodded. – "Yeah, I think so, why?" – "Fuck, that means we could listen to mah actual music instead of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy disc..." I thought for a while. – "Well, we still planned to head back to your house, I guess, so..." – "Oh, right... Thanks." Never thought that such a word will impress me, but if someone 8 hours ago would tell me that Sydney will say me thanks after, I wouldn't believe him. I just nodded, still heading back to my car. After a while, we were at the spot where I parked, so I started the engine and he took a seat. After a while, dealing with setting up car radio to play audio from his walkman, we started heading back to his house. He still was messing with buttons on this player and then music started to play. My ears perked up. – "Butterfly by Smile dk? Seriously?" I was holding myself from laughing, but since it was my client still, I contained myself. He decided to object. – "Hey, it's a nice tune!" I've just smirked and nodded. – "Yeah, yeah, as you wish." We continued heading to his house, sometimes staying up in a traffic jam, never thought that they ever could be here, but fine. What I noticed is that his music taste is... _Interesting_... Yeah, that's what I'm usually saying, when what I see or hear is weird as fuck, but I don't wanna offend a person. Among with many Drum and Bass songs, we literally could ride, listening to Girls Generation and I don't wanna ask how he found about them or blink-182. He really knows how to pick a music. After a while, we were near his house, so I stopped the car and looked at the window on his side. – "Guess time to say goodbye, huh?"
Otter's ears perked up and he nodded. – "Yeah." – "At my office on the next week. Be prepared to take evidence from residents." He just nodded and got up from my car. After I saw how he entered his house and closed a door, I started heading back to office. Smirking I just said – "What a moron..." Then I put back music I usually was listening through phone. After a while, I was at my office again, dealing with IBM PC, which now had 3 written "h" on the display. After half of an hour of doing that, it finally started working properly. People inside agency were side-eyeing me, because I was swearing at this black box, but it was worth. I really hoped that I could just scan papers I had and they would turn into readable document, but after I got gibberish text, for 5 times, I was disappointed in computers. – "Maybe if Jake was here..." Oh fucking no. If Jake was there, he would turn everything upside down and install his favorite Linux, because "Eww, you're slave of Microsoft, FOSS is our future!" and then I see how he's struggling teachers, because document he sent to teachers was completely different from what they've sent to him. So never. Sighing, I just moved keyboard closer to me and started to type word by word this document. After an hour, it was finished. I was over the moon at that moment. Last step was left is send it to our system... Yeah... Remember that we have old weak IBM PCs? Our system is the same old and weak... Sighing, I opened that icon and started waiting till it'll connect to servers... After 10 minutes PC made a sound. I fastly moved to it, to see what happened and... – "Fucking error with connecting to the server?! Are you fucking kidding me?!" Groaning, I pressed try again and after 5 minutes, it worked. Now all I needed to do is... _Sigh_ Login into my account, open a new case, write down driver's license number, copy that document, write down evidences and clues and attach them. God fucking damnit. Well, 1st step was passed easily.
Opening new case had some issues, since for the first time it got me an error, for some reason, but after 2nd time it just worked. Then I wrote down his license number from his agreement and after a minute loaded his photo. Well, I know everyone have issues with making normal photo on those documents, Jake's one literally just haven't aligned properly and 45% of it wasn't just captured, but here. Christ, he took it, after he was on a fight? Well it doesn't really matter, since other fields were correct. Then I attached document I copied from typewriter and photos of clues. Then described them. After that I pressed submit button and started to wait. 1 minute, 2 minute. Fucking progress bar was staying on 1%. 3 minutes, 4 minutes, nothing has changed. and then it suddenly jumped to 99% and it was submitted. After I was sure that it **really** was submitted, because once I forgot to do it and when I needed to add new evidences to that case it just wasn't there, I just turned off that PC and headed back to my home. This day definitely was something and I need to have a rest. When I was at my apartment, I opened the door and was welcomed with familiar rosin smell. Jake never stops from fixing some old tech from thrift store, for some reason. Then I took a shower and went to my bed. 
End of [[Глава 2. Первый день]]
Next 7 days weren't really interesting. Some cases were solved, some new appeared. I also had couple of concerts in our club. I slowly started to forget about Mr. Bronson, until I heard someone was knocking my door. – "Yeah?" Door opened and I saw Sydney. Well it took me some time, to understand that it was him, since he looked scuffed. He had some scratches, bite mark on his neck, plus he itself was sore. I blinked. – "God fucking damnit, Sydney. I told you to be prepared. That's not what I meant!" – "Mah bad, detective Hùndùn. Was in a... Fight..." He had stopped for a while, before saying "fight", but I haven't decided to point on this. I sighed.
– "Let's just hope no one will mind it." – I said, rubbing my eyelids Then I looked at him. He hesitated but then said. – "Let's start with Leonardo. Think it'll led us to less troubles, y'know" While he was saying that, I grabbed ad flair from his family's auto up and nodded. – "Around 300 kilometres aways from us. Think we'll be there in time." Then I moved it quite away to look at him, he was quite confused and mad. – "The fuck are kilometres? How many will it be in h–" – "1.5 hours." I've interrupted him and slowly started leaving our office. I waved my arm. – "Let's head out. The earlier we start, the earlier we'll end." He groaned, but followed me. We took a seat in my car and started heading out.
Our ride was silent, but it was clearly seen that he was hesitating to say me something. Looking through windshield at the road, I decided to say – "Go ahead, otter." – "Huh?" He was confused by my bluntness, but I've added – "Ride is going to be quite long, so don't be afraid with sharing something on your mind." He sighed, when I stopped at the crossroad. – "Well, do ya dr–" – "No." He stopped. Felt like I broke small hope of making conversation with that stubborn person, but then he continued. – "Well, I dream. And usually mah dreams are quite normal for person like me, but today it was like..." He sounded annoyed first, but then he noticed someone on the crosswalk. He smirked and chuckled a bit. – "Didn't know that hipsters are still alive. Thought they've died after Instagram became mainstream." I haven't paid attention to those words first, but then I focused on the crosswalk. Goddamn. That hipster was my roommate Jake, who carried another big heavy plastic bag. I honked twice and he jumped out like he saw a ghost. He fastly crossed road and noticed my car. He was quite confused seeing both of us at this moment, but when I waved to come in, he nodded and opened a door.
After he took a seat and closed the door. We 3 were completely silent. I continued heading to that place and decided to break the silence the most awkward way. Like a mom, who was taking her child and their friend to some place, I decided to say. – "Soooo, I'll let you get known eachother. Jake, that's my client Sydney and Sydney, that's my roommate Jacob." Jake was quite confused, holding this bag close to his body. Then he coughed and said – "U-uh... Nice to meet you, Sydney?" Sydney nodded and answered, looking through the rear-view mirror. – "Yeah, nice to meetcha, Jake." Then he continued telling me this dream story. – "Yeah, y'know. Usually, dreams aren't controllable. But this one... Man, it felt like a real life. I was part of meeting or so...? There was around 10 another otters around my height and they all were like... From parallel world, y'know?" I've just nodded, hearing this. Jake was concentrated on this monologue, but felt like he haven't got any word. Slowly, I started to get why. Usually, for me, who talks with thousands of people through my career, it's not hard to get what people mean even if they have strong accent. Sydney is an example of that strong accent. When, for me, his sentences makes sense, for someone, like Jake, who haven't been around many accents and already has small issues with understanding British accent, it sounds like... "Ye, y'know. Usually, ream arn't cuntrollable. But dis one... Man, it fel luke a ree life. I wa pa of meeti o so...? De wa round 10 anoder otter round mah hi and dey o we like... From palel wo, y'know?" I've slightly chuckled and added to Sydney's words. – "He's talking about his dream, which felt real, for him, Jake." Felt like Jake's lightbulb just lit up and he snapped his fingers – "Ah, lucid dreams? I had couple of those. They're cool." He smiled and Sydney continued
– "Yeah, and y'know what, man?" He stopped, so I've answered. – "What?" He was silent and then his tone got more serious. – "They were telling that they're just me, but different... Like they all were called Sydney Bronson and they all were from Echo..." I was silent, but then Jake decided to add. – "Well, maybe your brain has decided to scare you in a bit, hm? No matter if it's lucid or not, it's still a dream, made by your mind and based by your memories. So don't t–" Jake was always quite nerdy, when conversation started to go into some paranormal or strange stuff. He's a realist and always trying to find an adequate excuse to any kind of paranormal stuff. Feels like, Sydney doesn't like those people, so he said. – "Blah, blah, blah, that's all doesn't make sense. Felt like they were expecting me and so I should have too, but I haven't. Some of them were quite annoying, some of them were quite overconfident... They all hated me, when I decided to fix a microwave to cook a popcorn."
We two were silent and I've stopped at another traffic jam. I decided to ask. – "And why they were so mad?" He continued. – "Seems like they haven't liked that I managed to fix a microwave, using Taylor Swift album, wooden bar and electrical tape... Like c'mon?! Who ever listens to Taylor Swift? Especially, Speak Now album?" We two were silent, but Jake decided to add – "Maybe they were mad, because you broke some of their s–" Sydney interrupted – "Doesn't matter. I've managed to fix two of those bullshits, with some "dream magic" or so." Sarcastically, I've added. – "Try Cantonese one, next time, maybe it'll be more powerful." To be honest, I wasn't sure do he has real magic abilities, at least in dreams. Actually, I have some, but they're quite atavistic. First of all, they expect you to use Cantonese language, for some reason. Next, since we don't develop magic, now, I have basic abilities, only. Maybe in medieval age, my ancestors used magic to survive, but in current time it's just a gimmick for fun. I wasn't sure do he or even do otters have a magic abilities, at least in dreams. Carelessly, he said – "Uh huh, will try." Then he continued.
– "Rest of the night I was listening to my tunes and playing GameCube. For some reason they didn't like what I've listened." I thought, for a while, how to say. Through teeth, I said. – "Well, your taste in music is quite... Interesting..." Jake, smartass, decided to add. – "You faltered, Dean." He thought for a while and then snapped his fingers. – "While you sharing with us your story, Sydney, mind if I ask you to send me your playlist? I want to know what do you listen." Sydney was quite confused, but decided to hand him his Walkman. Jake looked at him with "are you kidding me?" expression, but slowly wore one of the earbuds and pressed play. By his surprised expression, I understood that he probably always has this strange music taste, so I'll let Jake suffer from it too. Sydney continued. – "Then, guess what? Some of the motherfuckers grabbed a fucking gun! I'm not even sure have he had a fucking license, but feels like no, since for disabled person, like him, it's hard to get it." He mumbled last sentence, but then continued. – "And guess what? When I felt that things are might getting shitty? I grabbed that GameCube and started running away..." He stopped, but when I wanted to say something, he continued. – "Soon after I appeared at the middle of Payton, once step from crossing the road? Is it even possible? I even woke up somehow. In the middle of Payton, at midnight, among car and road lights, holding GameCube." Jake looked like he was zoned out listening to the Sydney's music, but then said. – "Somnambulism. Guess you had one." Sydney blinked, but decided to say. – "In English? Please." – "Somehow you walked out from your house, carrying GameCube, while sleeping and then, you snapped back to reality, waking up at the middle of Payton." Sydney rolled his eyes, but haven't enough strength to beef with Jake, so he nodded. – "Maybe you're right." – "It's just an assumption, after all."
What always differed me from Jake is that he never was sure on what he said or did. He always in that limbo, without taking any responsibility. Think if instead of me, my college had Jake, their life would be more quiet, but more boring. After I got that thought, we were close to Payton. So I said – "Payton appears, soon we'll be at auto up." Jake was quite confused. – "Auto up, Dean?" I've nodded, smirking. – "Yeah, we're taking evidences today. Decided to catch you up. So at least for a single day our flat will not be filled with rosin smell." Jake was offended, but we both knew that it was the truth, so he haven't said anything else.
Sydney was silent after I said that to Jake, but then asked. – "Rosin?" I've nodded. – "Yeah, it's his hobby. He grabs some old stuff from Goodwill and trying to fix it. Says that he gets money from that. Am I right, Jake." Jake's ear perked up. He nodded. – "Yeah, yeah... I'm selling this stuff on eBay later. People are really interested in getting Betamax players or retro PCs. And Goodwill sells those dirt cheap, just because no one have fixed single capacitor, hah!" Sydney sighed, placing his paw on his face. – "Those fuckers could be wasteful, sometimes, god." I've just chuckled. – "And, since he uses soldering iron, his room is always filled with that smell." Then we 3 were silent, until I parked near "Alvarez's Auto Up" building. All, I said, was. – "Arrived." Then we all got up from my car. Jacob handed Walkman to Sydney. Then said, scratching back of his head – "Thanks for giving me it." Sydney roughly grabbed it and asked. – "How was it?" Otter was hesitating to answer, but then find strength and decided to say what he thinks to Sydney. – "Oh, it felt like 2000s alt girl playlist from MySpace. Like the one who always have black and pink or red on her profile and it filled with glitter gifs. She also discovered alt culture recently, so that's why she have gi–" – "Enough." Sydney sighed, rubbing his eyelids and putting back his Walkman to pocket. He turned back to me. – "What? He always was like this. That's why we usually listen to his music in the car." Sydney rolled his eyes and I decided to change the topic. – "Since we're here. We need to discuss again all what we know, right now, Sydney." I grabbed notepad and started flipping pages. – "So, we got that ad flair on that van and you say that you know someone here... May we call him today to gather some questions or not?" Otter thought for a while, then waved his arms. – "Gah, I dunno, man. He defo should be there, but will he be free for a talk...? See, they have a lunch breaks..."
He was hesitating before he continued – "We can try to catch his ass at that moment, but he'd been through a lot recently and food is the o–" I interrupted him. – "When his lunch breaks start?" – "At 3PM." Suddenly, Jake entered this conversation. – "Uhh... Guys...?" He slowly raised up his phone. 2:58PM. Sydney grabbed his cap on the head with his paws. – "Fuck, go! Now!" He ran away to entrance, so I followed him. Since I was faster, I already was staying at the entrance, when he just appeared near it. I've opened a door. Inside, it was a simple building. Well Payton is not big and modern like the Fort Allen for example, but even for Payton it was really old and simple building. Jake would call it "Functional". At the entrance was staying some small and young wolf. Maybe it's his part-time job. Like with open hands, Sydney started to talk. – "Ho, who's there? Hey, Huddie!" Wolf looked at him, like he was ready to kill him. – "How much need I to say ya... NEVER CALL ME HUDDIE, SYD! MAH NAME'S HUDSON! PERIOD! I'M GONNA T–" I coughed. – "Detective Húndún. We're here not for fixing a vehicle or so. May we ask you to call one of the employees here." I had usual, neutral-angry type of expression. And again I was taller than he too. He rubbed his eyes and stopped thinking of the otter. He coughed. – "Which one, coyot–" – "Húndún. I'd like to be called Húndún." He mumbled "What a weirdo." and then asked again. – "Which one? We have shit ton of employees here." I showed him ad flair from that place and answered. – "Leonardo Alvarez. We need to gather some questions from him, okay?" He rolled his eyes and then yelled – "REZ! THOSE WEIRDOS WANNA GET SOME QUESTIONS FROM YA. GET YO ASS HERE RIGHT NOW!" Quiet groan was from the other side of the building and, after a minute, big red wolf, almost my height, appeared near us. Sydney waved. – "Hey, Leonardo." That wolf was confused by company of us, but after a while he started talking. He had strong Spanish accent.
– "So they are those weirdos you asked me to run for? I thought collectors decided to visit us today or so." He chuckled. – "So who ya brought today, Syd? Never seen someone like he in our places, heh." I sighed. – "Detective Húndún. We need to get some questions from you." Sydney thought for a while. – "He needs to. I'm just like, y'know, helper." Wolf blinked. – "Fine... Let's head out to some more private place, to not talk with him." Other wolf entered this conversation – "Oh, not so needed!" Leonardo rolled his eyes and navigated us to place, which looked like where he had his lunch usually. We took a seat. I was silent, then wolf started to talk. – "So..." I opened my mouth, but then wolf stopped me. – "First of all, Sydney." Wolf sighed, rubbing his eyes. – "Is that your new boyfriend or so?" We both blinked and simultaneously said – "He's not my boyfriend." – "He's not mah boyfriend." Then I rubbed my eyelids and put ad flyer on the table. – "We found it on the van where happened incident in 2003. There's Alvarez's name on it." Wolf looked on it. – "God, ad flyer? We haven't used those since 2010..." I grabbed notepad and took a note. – "So it was made before 2010, right?" Wolf looked around. – "Well, at one moment I begged my parents to make a website and use online ads, but..." I sighed. – "Do you know anything about 2003 Incident or how that flyer appeared on that van?" Leonardo started to think, so Sydney added. – "The one where my dad had died..." Suddenly, I noticed that Jake always was next to him. He always was silent unintentionally, but at this moment it just looked hilarious. To make it worse, he asked. – "Wait, your father has died?" Sydney screamed, but it sounded more like yodelling and suddenly grabbed his gun. Leonardo got up and said. – "Chill the fuck out, you two!" He sighed. – "Puchica..." Then he sat back again and continued, while 2 otters, were catching a breath.
– "Yeah... At one day we gotta news that he was found dead. But no one have found a body or so. Initially, we had a gossip, that he got lost. No one had seen him for a week or so, so we asked Sydney. He said that he killed himself. We all got confused. We never would think that he would prefer be dead. One person made a gossip that Sydney was a killer, after that. Even so they two still don't talk with eachother, since they two are staying at their points." After I took another portion of notes, I asked a question. – "So how is it connected to van?" Wolf looked at me and blinked. – "I didn't know that van was part of the incident. When mah mamá gave me those flyers, she said me to put em on any car in Echo and mailboxes. So that's what I did in the timeline from 2007 to 2009." I sighed, rubbing my eyelids and took last note. – "So lemme recheck, what we have right now. So no one heard of Bronson's death, at the first time, and even after they got news, they made many gossips against Sydney Bronson, right?" Wolf thought for a while. – "I wasn't part of those false assumptions. I just had no other choice, but trust them." Sydney deadly looked at him – "Seriously?!" Wolf sighed. – "Syd, no one thought that your father could just decide to kill himself. Would be more expected if he had killed someone, instead." Sydney rolled his eyes. –"Mhm, mhm, sure." I continued. – "So, since that flyer was our false lead, mind tell us who made those gossips?" Wolf was hesitating, so Sydney said. – "Leonardo, tell him." Wolf sighed. – "Chase Hunter. He now lives in Pueblo, maybe you three can try your luck to get some information from him." I rolled my eyes, then slowly started getting up. – "Is there something else we should know about that?" Wolf thought for a while and sighed. – "I think, if we were talking about same vans, that van is somehow connected to the Echo. You can take it as urban legend, but it might be true..." I sighed, but asked. – "White one?"
Then I grabbed my phone and after finding a picture of, I showed it. He stared at it for a while, then nodded. – "Yeah. This one. Now folks, who interested in abandoned places, likes to take pictures near it. Sometimes they see some figures there. When I tried to drive it to our Auto Up, it didn't let me do it." I sighed, fully getting up. – "Well, anyways, it might help us, thank you and goodbye." Meanwhile, Sydney was talking with Jake, not paying attention to us. When I started heading back to exit, he said. – "Already? How was it" I turned to him, but Leonardo started talking first. – "Well, think I gave him all what I know. Hope it'll help y'all solve that case." I waved my paw. – "We need to head out to next place. He might gave us a hint, or no. Anyways, time is running out." Sydney waved his paw. – "Well, see ya, Leonardo." Wolf nodded, while we was halfway to exit and said. – "Hear ya." When we left this building and entered my car, I entered new address. GPS said it out loud. – _**"13 Maple Street. Pueblo. You should reach your destination in 50 minutes."**_ Sydney's ear perked up. – "Pueblo? What we forgot in Pueblo?" I sighed. – "Well, someone here made gossips about you, right. We should need to ask them too." He rolled his eyes, but I started the engine and we started to head out. Then I groaned, since I remembered. I tapped couple of buttons on car radio and after a while started to play since music. And some music was very extensive term here, since for me it just sounded like a noise and music without any logic. Meanwhile, Jake calls it "real music" and "you just don't understand J-Core and breakcore". Sydney looked confused, but it was mixed with anger. Smiling, Jake said – "Thanks, Dean. After Mr. Bronson's music, it's just a fresh air." Sydney, groaned. – "Oh, so that's what you listen to? It doesn't make any s–" Jake interrupted.
– "No, those artists spends hours or even days to find exact good sample for their music to put it at certain moment to make it feel less blank. It's just modern piece of music. So futuristic. Every glitch adds it's own colour to the song and each sample make it feel more real and less "produced" you just need to understand it. It's easy, just take it as a blank c–" Sydney interrupted. – "Whatever, I don't care." He slowly started to get his earphones on, but Jake stopped him. – "No, I gave you a chance, give me one too. At least will have a reason for hate." Sydney rolled his eyes. – "Aight... Let's give it a try." He crossed his arms and Jake smiled again, deep diving into his feelings of current music. To be fair, I don't understand his taste either. Like those artists just make straight bass boosted kick snare beat, but then suddenly it turns into glitch mess or loud high pitched hardcore drums? Like why? And after all of this, sudden Japanese girl start to talk, like it's a news channel. But we already made a rule that on odd days we listen to my music in a car and on even days we listen to his music. So, since it's his day, we need to struggle for the next 40 minutes...
_If I only could draw... Just imagine poker-facing coyote on the wheel and annoyed brown otter, crossing his arms, on front seats and happy, dancing, almost black otter on the back seat, while they all listen to one of those kind of songs, sitting in a car._ After 25 minutes, Sydney's eyes were completely red, filled with insanity, so he decided to press pause button on a car radio, while Jake was jamming and yelling something like "DROP IT AND GO!". Then he smirked, crossing his arms. – "Enough of this bullshit." Jacob moved to Sydney's seat, being confused. – "Why, Mr. Bronson? You didn't like what I listen?" Jake's tone might sounded teasing for someone, like Sydney, so he raised he raised his fist, turning to Jake. – "Oh you little piece of shi–" I stopped him, by grabbing his arm. – "Stop it there, you two." I turned to Mr. Bronson, first. – "Keep fists to yourself. We're here not for showdown of two persons who can't handle eachother's music taste." I sighed, rubbing eyelids. – "神啊，你在何處...?" Jake turned to otter and said. – "I– I really... just wanted to know your opinion about my music taste, Mr. Bronson. That's all..." – "You got it. It sounds like someone has captured this metallic sound of speakers when someone call ya. Or just nail across the glass" Sydney scoffed. Jake sighed. – "Mr. Bronson. It's... It's more than just electric sounds. It's an art of understanding many synthesizers, how to program them and where to add this small sample to make entire music feel full and complete... I just... Want you to understand that this is music too." Sydney rolled his eyes. – "Too many words. Don't shit mah music taste next time." We both sighed, but Sydney pressed play button and music continued playing. To be honest, knowing Jake, he never was the one who would shit someone's preferences. Criticize? Yes, but happened that Mr. Bronson thinks that any kind of negative opinion might offend him.
After next 15 minutes, I saw Pueblo sign. We're at the city, that red wolf told us head to. Now we need to find a place where Chase Hunter lives. That brainstorm was interrupted by confused Sydney. – "Pueblo? No-no-no, I'm out. I don't wanna deal again with these 2 bitches. No. Don't pay money or ask me to. No, period." While he was saying this, he attempted to escape car. But I'm always lock it and we were driving at quite fast speed. Jake decided to stop him, being unironically shocked by his attitude. – "No, Mr. Bronson! Stop! We're at 55 miles per hour, you want to die?!" Sydney turned to him and smirked. – "What if I want to?" I rolled my eyes, deciding to stop these two – "Fine. You two will stay outside. I'll take evidences from Mr. Hunter by myself. Dealt?" Sydney groaned, since that meant that he'll stay with Jake, but unwillingly agreed. – "Aight..." Jake, felt a bit excited, since he thought that this way he'll know Sydney better. After some time, we were at the place. Big apartment. – "Look, just like our place, Dean!' Jake said, being excited. I sighed. – "We don't know which flat belongs to him." – "How detective doesn't know where the fuck person is." Sydney scoffed. I slightly groaned, at this teasing comment. – "I'll work something out." I waved my hand, getting out of the car. – "Let's go."
Just a basic tall building. That's what I thought after we all got out and were next to the door. – "Know a code?" Sydney asked, pointing at intercom with his thumb. They even don't have concierge. How could I know where is the floor Mr. Hunter lives. Then I saw how some husky was going to this house. He waved to us. – "Heeey! You wait for someone?" I blinked and wanted to answer, but Sydney take the lead – "We need to enter this apartment as soon as possible." Husky looked around and nodded. – "Oh, oh. Why didn't y'all say it before?" He pressed his key to this intercom and door has opened with continuous sound. We've entered this apartment and he called elevator. – "Visiting someone? Haven't seen here before, folks." Then elevator ringed and we've entered. I coughed and started talking – "Uhm... Yeah, we need to talk with Mr. Hunter an–" He interrupted. – "Oh!" Among, with pressed already, 6th button he pressed 10th button. – "He lives at 142 apartment." I've nodded and then elevator has stopped. Husky left and, before saying goodbye, he said, waving. – "Hope y'all get along with him.!Bye, bye!" Jake smiled back and waved him, while door was closing. – "Goodbye, Mr. Husky!" Then, silently we continued getting up to 10th floor. Sydney was mad and mumbled. – "Don't like those fuckers." After a while, we were at 10th floor and head to 142 apartment. I turned to Jake and Sydney. – "Stay here. I'll try to talk with him." Jake nodded and went to the wall against the door. Unwillingly, Sydney followed him. I nodded back and rang the doorbell. Door has opened and I heard 2 voices. One was belong to female and was a bit raspy, while other one was quite high and almost singing one. It was closer to the door, saying. – "Coming!" Then door opened, but I haven't saw anyone. – "Hey, we don't need anyth–" Then, I turned my head down. Otter. quite bright-furred than Sydney. He was quite shocked. Voice behind him decided to ask, going to him. – "Honey, who just came ag–"
She stopped and looked at me too. Fennec, quite the same height as this otter or maybe slightly shorter. I still was standing here. We all were speechless, but then I started talking. – "I–" I fastly was interrupted by fennec. – "Who is he?" I was quite shocked by that attitude, but continued. – "I'm detective Húndún. Gathering some evidences for client and you're on the list... Think you two." They both looked at me, like I was joking. I continued. – "What?" They two teasingly smiled and fennec continued. – "Sorry, but you? Detective? Don't make us l–" I stopped her, by showing them two detective licence. – "May I enter, just to ask some questions?" They two, incredulously nodded and we've entered. Flat was even smaller than what we share with Jake. And I thought that I don't have enough space to live. Even though they act like the world is theirs and they have any rights to treat people who they think lower their level. I sighed. Then otter started talking. – "Take off this cap." This? I frowned and asked. – "Why?" – "We have rules to take off caps especially... **These ones**." I rolled my eyes and hang my cap. What do they have against my cap is such secret. But all I needed is answers. I took off my coat and they two smirked to eachother. Maybe it's self-explanatory, now, why Sydney is so easy-offended. I sighed and we three took a seat at the coffee table. Fennec, felt like, didn't like that I took a seat on this chair, but she haven't said anything, so I started talking. – "So we're here, because someone told me that here lives Mr. Hunter. The Gossiper." Otter blinked. – "Gossiper?! I'm not gossiper I–" – "Who made a gossip about death of Mr. Bronson sr.?" I looked at the otter and he was quite confused. Then fennec interrupted. – "Wait, we're here because of Syd and his problems?!" – "Yes and I'll give you some questions too." Otter decided to stop her a bit. – "Jenna, We can talk about it later. Don't you see that were talking with detective, here?"
Last sentence was said quite teasingly, but I continued. – "So, according to Mr. Alvarez's words, you, Mr. Hunter made a gossip that... Erm, "Sydney has killed his father." May I get some information about this? Chase rolled his eyes. – "Listen. We all were kids and Sydney... He was weird. Weird, with his strange music taste, love to pirates and wrestling and also making strange trash hunting games. Of course, knowing that he had problems with his fucking dad, I gave a gossip he might killed him. He always was at hunting with him and death happened at that place too, so..." I nodded. – "So, that gossip was made, because of the fact that he might knew how to use a shotgun and the fact that he hated his father, hmm. Might say more or?" He sighed. – "At that day, I was minding my own business with others, when Carl asked where's Sydney today. Flynn said that he'll not join us today and we started making gossips. Then, on the next day, Sydney said that his dad shot himself. That made us make more gossips. One of which sounded most believable. We didn't thought that he'll shot himself. More likely he'll shot his son, instead, but guess we didn't know something." Then, Jenna added. – "Or maybe gossip was right. Don't you remember what he did, month after, with TJ?" Otter gasped. – "Oh, please, don't remind me. Such a poor soul." I rolled my eyes. – "So, long story short. Mr. Bronson's death was caused by shotgun, almost without a trace, at hunting morning. And you two don't know a reason why, right?" Jenna hesitated, but decided to say. – "Uhm... He was always insane and religious to the bone... Also, sometimes, was groaning at the silence, like fighting or arguing with someone. Looking back, maybe he just another insanity impulse which made him do this...?" I took last note in notepad, while listening to this. – "Don't have to say anything else?" They both nodded. I sighed. – "Then, guess... We can stop here." I grabbed from pocket some old card
– "Incase you'll have something else to say." I handed it to otter and started getting up. They two got up and followed me. – "Oh lemme navigate." Otter said. I turned back, then silently put on my cap and coat. Opening door, I said. – "Goodbye." Then I saw this. Against the wall, crossing arms, Jake was talking to Sydney, who was lying on the floor and smoking a blunt. Jenna made a face full of disgust. – "God, you brought him too?!" Jake waved to fennec. – "Hello Mr. Otter and Mrs. Fennec! I'm Jacob!" Jenna was holding from bursting out to laugh. – "So, Jacob... This detective has finished here, so I'm asking you all. GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY HOUSE!" She yelled last sentence, what made Jake almost cry. Suddenly, Sydney appeared infront of her. – "Shut the fuck up, Jasmyn! No one asked yer bitchy opinion." She chuckled. – "Oh look, homeless people decided to fight for his place again." Otter was full of madness, being ready to punch her, so he bared his arms. I stood up against both of them. – "Stop. We'll go. BUT THERE WAS NO NEED TO ACT SO ABRASIVE AGAINST JAKE! UNDERSTOOD?!" I was talking, baring my fangs. She chuckled. – "Alright, alright. Just leave this place, right now. Understood?" I rolled my eyes, going away. – "Fine, Jake, Sydney, let's get outta here." They followed me and I heard how door was slamming. Our next silence was broken by Sydney. – "Never liked them. Mean bitches, who don't know their fucking place, but think that world spins around their dicks." Jake decided to say. – "But fe–" Sydney interrupted. – "I don't fucking care. They always act like they're having the best life among anyone one who left from Echo. God, I fucking hate those fake families, fake lives and fake peoples." At the last sentence, Sydney smashed button panel and elevator just stopped. Jake sighed. – "Aw, Sydney, now we're stuck here..." He pressed a call button on the elevator, waiting for help. Sydney decided to say.
– "Not mah fault that they live in such a cheap house with cardboard elevator." – "Sydney!" Jake exclaimed.
After some time, someone picked up the call. Quality of speakers was unexplainably shitty, but we managed to hear some words. – "... problem? Allo?" Jake wanted to say something, but Sydney moved him away and started talking. Not a good sign. – "Erm, s'this elevator's stuck, y'know? May ya fix it or, so?" Silence. After a good minute and half, that person continued talking. – "How did it happen?" We all three were so silent like it was a funeral. He asked again. – "Allo?" We all three shrugged and Sydney continued. – "We... Uhh... Pressed a button to 1st level, then it started goin down, but somewhere at the... Middle? It shook and froze here. It doesn't answer any button, but this." Jacob felt insane by how Sydney just lied about what actually happened, but haven't did or said something. Then, that person answered. – "Yeah, you're stuck between 7th and 6th floor... Try not to do anything, I'll try to make it move to any of those floors." Then, elevator tried to go down. It hasn't led to anything. Sydney groaned, but fastly stopped, after that person continued. – "Still stuck. I'll better call fire department. They might help you, but they'll be here in... 30 minutes or so... Stay there and try not to do anything, before they come." Then he hung up. Sydney groaned. – "Great...! Great! We stuck at this bitchy house for the next 30 minutes! Why do they all live so high?" I rolled my eyes. – "Well, maybe if somebody haven't decided to hit that panel, we would already sit in my car." Jake stood for a while and then grabbed his phone. Sydney looked at him. – "The fuck... Are ya doin?" Jake just shrugged. – "Well, if we're stuck here for the next 30 minutes, I'll just play something on my phone." Otter rolled his eyes. Next 15 minutes we still were standing in elevator. Then, Sydney groaned. – "Fuck it! He'll not come." He jumped to the elevator door and attempted to open it. I grabbed him, tugging him back. Not what I'd like to do at this moment.
Well, long story short, we managed to get out of here, with help from fire department. But Sydney was arrogant and stubborn, so I had some issues with making him chill out. If Jacob hasn't started talking with him, guess it would take much more time. Somehow they believed Sydney's words about broken panel and that it was already broken, when we entered. It's just a miracle. Then, we ran away and get to the car. Jake started talking again. – "Glad that we got out of here... Phew... Just imagine if we'd stuck here for a longer time, am I right?" Sydney was silent for a good minute, but then started talking. – "I'd manage to get us outta there, faster. But he wouldn't let me do it. I did it so much times..." I rolled my eyes. – "Yeah, I'd like to see how _you_ get a 160 pound otter and 155 pound coyote out of the elevator." Sydney looked at me, being annoyed. – "Whatever. May we visit someone else today?" I looked at the clocks. 5:12PM. Sighing, I asked. – "Who else?" – "Well, there's one fella at the edge of Payton. He has some records from the past, y'know. We might get some help from him." I sighed. – "Fine, the rest we'll visit in the next days. Okay?" Sydney nodded. – "He lives at Brooks Avenue, 90. We'll be here in 1 hour, I guess." Then I started the engine and put in GPS this address. I turned back Jake's music. – "No, we'll not change it." I said, to prevent conflicts. Next half hour was silent. But Jake decided to talk with otter again. – "I'm... I'm sorry, Mr. Bronson..." Sydney was confused. – "What? For what?" – "I think I was rude, when the elevator stopped. I just want to say I was too emotional and–" – "I don't care. We get outta that goddamn house and that's all that matters." Sydney stopped him. Jake was confused. – "Uh, okay...?" Then the silence has continued. Only that strange music of Jake was breaking this. After a while we were at the place. Well, it looked like some grotesque house. Not a common style for a house, I'd say.
After we got out of the car, Sydney called at the doorbell and it opened.
Creek of the door and that person started talking – "... If that's another seller, no I don't want another v–" Ram looked at the 2 of us, since Sydney was behind, and was confused. Jacob started talking. – "Hello, Mr. Ram." He waved his paw. Then, from behind, Sydney pushed us apart and patted Ram's shoulder. – "He-e-ey, Blaze! Long time no see, hah!" Wasn't expecting to see him this happy, especially, after what happened in the elevator. – "Bronski?! Haha, sure... Who are those guys?" Ram quickly went to the serious tone, at the last sentence. I coughed. – "I'm Detective Hùndùn. Solving the case of Mr. Bronson sr.'s death. And you are...?" – "Carl Hendricks." I've nodded. I heard something about Hendricks family before. If he's part of this exact family, his ancestor, should be the founder of Echo.... Then Jacob decided to interrupt my brainstorm. – "And I'm Jake. Nice to meet you Mr. Hendricks." He extended his arm and they both had a handshake. After a small pause, I continued. – "We need to take some evidence about the incident. May I ask you a couple of questions?" Ram nodded and invited us inside. – "Sure." After we entered, Sydney ran away to one of the rooms. When I wanted to say something, Ram continued. – "Okay, so..." We three took a seat at the coffee table. – "So what do I know is that Mr. Bronson sr. was "always insane", which made him kill himself at one hunting morning with a shotgun. And Chase Hunter made a gossip that Sydney Bronson might have killed him, because they two weren't in a great relationship. So, the question is, do you know anything more about Mr. Bronson sr.? His life before, or maybe strange moments from his life..."
Ram nods a couple of times. – "Can't say that he always was insane, even if I always saw him like this. He was a religious Mormon and, that maybe caused Chase to think that he's insane. He liked to control Sydney, but I still think that it's just a cause of being religious. But, according to my mom's words, she doesn't remember him being "insane" before the 1970s or so... So maybe **something has happened** at that moment...?" Jake decided to add – "Maybe, he was traumatized by something too...?" We both blinked. – "Like...?" Ram started asking, but Jake continued. – "PTSD, it can cause difficulties in a person's life. Maybe that was the reason why? Something traumatizing has happened in his life and he couldn't just live peacefully with it. Maybe his wife has di–" – "**Eliza**? No, she is still alive. Syd visits her, from time to time..." Jacob has nodded. – "Hmm..." I've interrupted. – "Do we have any records from that time. Documents, newspapers...?" Ram nodded. – "Yeah, my mom should have something from that time... We can visit her next Sunday, if you don't mind." I thought for a while. – "Okay... Anything else? Maybe **incident at the lake Emma**?" Ram has coughed. – "What about it?" – "Chase claims that Sydney almost killed somebody called "TJ". I'd be glad to know something more about it." I elaborated.
– "Oh, this..." Ram started – "We all were young and were fooling around on the lakeside. Sydney and TJ were playing in the lake, when, at one moment, Sydney climbed on TJ's back and was riding him, while he was swimming. According to their words, they both were okay with this... Except Chase. Chase thought that Sydney was killing TJ, like Mr. Bronson sr., so Chase attacked Sydney and they two had drowned. After a while, Sydney's head was on the lake's surface and he came up to the lakeside, with Chase. Sydney felt passed out, but everybody paid attention to Chase. Chase got away with the fact that he almost killed Syd, because he said that he was thinking that Sydney is killing TJ."
We three were silent. – "God... I'm sorry for Mr. Bronson..." Jake started. – "I can relate. Being falsely assaulted always hurts, especially at such a young age. What about you? Have you trusted him?" Jake looked at Carl, asking this. Ram nods. – "I haven't seen the exact picture, before Sydney explained it to me. So I thought Chase was right. Even tho, it was rude that most of the attention was to Chase." We both nodded. After some silence, Carl decided to say. – "I have some digital copies of tapes from 00s. Maybe they can help you too in solving this?" I nodded. – "Yeah, could say earlier. Where are they?" – "I know... They're on my Xbox. It's down there." He pointed at the Room Sydney had entered half an hour ago, so we headed. Carl knocked the door and I heard some slight scream and falling something down. – "Bitch..." Sydney said, what made Carl be confused. – "Uhm, Sydney? We need to enter." – "Ehh, one moment." After half a minute, the door opened and Sydney was panting, being red. No, I hope he hasn't done this. – "What do y'all need, guys?" – "Mr. Hendricks has some data on the Xbox, which might be important for me." Sydney was confused by my words and looked at the ram. – "Carl?" – "Those VHS records from the camera, my dad had. I showed you them 2 years ago. Forgot?" He elaborated. – "Ahh, those? Yeah, sure." We've entered his room. It seemed quite messy, but not dirty. Not like it was bothering me now. I handed Carl a flash drive, and, after some clicks on the gamepad, we started waiting until it finished copying. Then he handed it back to me. – "We might ask for original copies, in case they're needed." I said, putting back the flash drive. – "I'm okay with it." He said back. Then, I slightly clapped my paws and turned Sydney – "Okay, time to go back, I guess." – "I'll stay here." We all were confused by Sydney's response. – "Mr. Bronson?" Jake said. – "Let's continue next week, if ya don't mind. I wanna stay here today."
After Jake gave his goodbyes to Carl and Sydney we went back to my car. After door has closed I gave a light groan. When I was about to head back to office, I had an idea. – "We're heading to Echo." – "Wasn't it... abandoned?" Jake asked, being confused. I nodded – "Right... Last time I was here, with him, there was nobody, but us. I want to see, have I missed something there." Jake sighed, but nodded. – "Maybe you're right." Then, we headed to Echo. After half of an hour of a ride, Jake started talking. – "Dean... Are you really... uh... Sure that it's possible to solve it?" I Was silent, staring at the road. To be fair, I wasn't either sure about it. – "Every case needs to be s–" – "Yeah, but... I feel like there's something behind that case." Jake decided to interrupt me with that. – "Hm?" – "Okay. What have you found out so far about it?" I was silent for quite a long time, until GPS said me to take a turn to the left. I sighed. – "We have old pistols, from the place of his death, we know that he killed himself in front of Sydney..." – "What about the gossipers?" Jake decided to ask – "...I think you saw, by the reaction of you two, how helpful they were. They told me that Sydney could kill his father because he attempted to kill whoever is TJ." – "Yeah, Mr. Bronson told me about that too." – "And that ram... God, they all know only that side of the story..." I handed notebook to Jake – "Uh...?" – "To not waste a time," – I continued – "let's think to who should we go next. If we're just going to start asking everyone from that city, it's gonna last for years." Jake nodded. – "Okay, so far, we know about Sydney Bronson, who saw that incident around the age of 10, Chase Hunter, who made a gossip, Carl Hendricks and Leonardo Alvarez, who followed that gossip, Mrs. Hendricks, who collects some history stuff about Echo and Mrs. Bronson, which is Sydney's mother... Also, we have VHS archive on the flash drive." Jake was noting all that, while I was brainstorming.
– "...I think we should exclude Chase, Carl and Leonardo? I doubt they have something else to say." I was silent, thinking about that. – "Exclude Chase and Leonardo. I think Carl still might know something... And leave it that way, for now. We need to write down more people here, but I can't remember their names." Jake sighed. – "Maybe we'll switch the topic a bit?" – he asked – "...He decided to tell me his recent dream." I didn't think it was important at this moment, but I nodded. – "What can you add?" – "I still think that he was sleepwalking, but he was telling that dream like it was a part of his life... a creepy life..." I slightly rolled my eyes. His grading of creepiness was different than mine and mostly, it wasn't something that scare. – "Dean! I'm not kidding. He saw his copies and was managed to talk with them, but after got shot." I nodded. – "Right, he said that already in the car, forgot? I don't think, it matters now." – "But... But, Dao!" I suddenly stopped, and honked a car in front of me. – "We've talked about that already, 戇鳩." – "What's wrong with that? It's really not someth–" – "Just stop." – I groaned. – "We've talked, about that, many times." Rest of the ride, was in the complete awkward silence, until we arrived. I stopped the car and was standing inside for a while. I wasn't sure was it worth to do all that. Every case needs to be solved, but what if Jake was right? There's no way back, I think. I switch off the ignition, then I hopped out of the car. Jake followed me. Echo was darker today and... – "The sound." – "What?" Jake was confused as I – "I swear to god, when we were here last time I heard some loud sound, which was getting on nerves! Why did it disappeared?" – "Maybe it's not the day, D-Dean?" I was confused. Sound, was, actually, helping us find that van... I decided to go the way I remembered. Of course, all the traces were gone already, so It's literally an aimless roaming... – "Dean! Don't forget about me!" Jake said.
Leaves and dry grass were rustling on our feet. So far we still had any clue where that van was... Was it even worth to f– – "Hey!" My train of thoughts was stopped, by some strange voice, so I turned back. It wasn't Jake...? I started looking around. – "Yes, you two!" That voice continued. – "Dean, wh–" I covered Jake's mouth with my paw. Silence. Was that voice went away...? Hoping, I slowly started going further. – "Not so fast!" I rolled my eyes, still going. – "Or what?! What else?!" Suddenly, I heard how a gun was loaded and then, it touched my nose. Jake started whimpering and I tried to shush him. – "How about this...? You'll leave this city right now..." – "Or...?" I've asked. So far, I still think that this man was bluffing. – "Or you two will leave it dead." I've raised my eyebrow. – "... Why would we even... What's the point of all this." That man slighltly groaned. – "**Two years, we hadn't had any issues in this city.** Two holy years, gifted by a god. **Last week**, you invaded us, bringing **your little friend**" He pointed at Jake, for some reason. Then, continued. – "**And this place turned into a nightmare again!** So, till it hasn't happened again, leave this place. Or I'll make you leave it faster." Jake looked at me and I looked back. I loosen my grip, showing both of my paws, like I got caught. – "Fine, fine, your wish. We're going back..." I nodded to Jake and he nodded back. We started running away. Last words I heard from that man were – "Never come back...! wish...! troubles...!" Then, we were standing next to my car again. Both, catching breath and trying to understand what that all was...
– "Why he pointed at me?" That was the first, what Jake asked me. – "I... I... Sydney was with me, last week. He has asked me to catch some evidence here... I dunno why he pointed at... Otter..." Moment of realization hit me... – "What?" – "Yeah... It makes sense... You and Mr. Bronson are the otters..." – "Right, but... What does it mean...?" – "He thought that you're the Sydney... One, who was "giving troubles" here... I need to grab more evidence here..." – "Oh, good, good... But how you're going to make it possible, if he doesn't want to see us here?" I sighed... He was right, that man probably wouldn't leave us alone... – "Will come up with it later. Think his words are already good enough to add for the evidence..." I've opened up the door and ignited the car. Jake entered too and we started moving away from that city. Back to Allen. I've asked Jake to note that man's words, since they could've help us in future. Sad, that we hadn't had a chance to investigate the van again. I was hoping to capture that weird creature or grab more evidences near it. Hope next week will be more worthful. After we were at the detective agency, I've asked Jake. – "Wanna enter, or gonna come back home?" Jake nodded. – "Don't mind either of those. Can enter." He followed me to my cabinet. I started turning on that horrific PC and Jake chuckled. – "You sure you don't wanna try WDFSPCS, if they doesn't wanna update your computer park?" – "You hear yourself? It doesn't even sound like a normal word. If it's also just a black screen with a small text at the corner, I'll not gonna use it." – "What's wrong with terminal? It's really convenient!" – "So convenient, that you spent 2 sleepless weeks trying to... How was it called? Make your audio card working?" – "I had a sleep!" – "Jake, your eyebags could handle 7 pounds of potatoes and I'm not kidding. Now stop talking and give me a notepad." Jake was silent. – "You forgot it in the car?" He silently nodded. – "Why am I not surprised...?"
