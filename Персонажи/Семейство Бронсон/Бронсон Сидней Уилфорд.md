Сидней является 25-летним выдром. Имеет странный акцент и агрессию к людям. Готов орать на людей по мелочам. Считает себя главнокомандующим. 
- He doesn't know modern tech at all. Attempted to smash screen with index finger, while typing address.
- Think that tapes are still modern. He doesn't look like hipster, which makes me confused.
- Somewhere, underneath his t-shirt, he's literally carrying CD with album of Kanye West.
- Live in a completely small house, what doesn't bother him at all.
- Using a mid 2007 iMac. In 2017.
- For somewhat reason, all, for what we needed to drive to his house, first, was to get a revolver (okay?) and snacks. When I asked him about it, he said that he have a license.
- All the way to his house and to Echo, we were listening to entire Album CD, which lasts only 1 hour and 8 minutes, so we were listening to it again and again.
- When we've arrived, Echo was completely abandoned, among with the night, it gave really strange feeling.
